# sentiment_analysis
A simple logistic regression application to predict the response of a customer, based on the reviews given by them. This can then be used to target a specific client base for some particular products/services.
The jupyter notebook specifies each step in detail, along with the uses of each library and function that have been implemented in the code.
I've also uploaded the dataset used in the model, in the folder named 'archive'.
With the 'archive' folder and the notebook downloaded in the same folder, this code can be run on any local machine.
